title: Service Discovery
---

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';


The key difference between FSDLP and prior solutions is its decentralized nature. Rather than a single entity federating communications between aircraft, air traffic units, and virtual airline operations centers, the responsibility is shared between all participants.

To facilitate this, a method for service discovery is necessary, as an airborne client must know which provider clients are available and what capabilities they posess. A pre-determined port range of `60860—60867` is used to make port scanning easier for airborne clients.

:::note
The port range above only allows for **up to eight clients** on a single machine. We believe this to be a sufficient quantity, as there are typically at most two at any given moment: a network and a virtual airline. A tigher range reduces the amount of work that clients must perform in order to complete a scan.

## Identification

The service discovery flow boils down to requesting identification details from a potential provider client on one of the pre-defined ports, and using that information to determine where to route downlink messages.

Identification is performed over HTTP with the `/id` endpoint, over which provider clients will provide a JSON payload matching the schema provided below.

### Schema

```json """" "[]" {"1":5} {"2":6} {"3":7}
{
    "protocol": "fsdlp",
    "version": 1,
    "provider": {
        "name": "",
        "type": "",
        "features": []
    }
}
```

1. The `name` field shall be a brief identifier of the network, virtual airline, or other kind of provider. This information may be shown in virtual cockpits when prompting pilots to establish a data link connection.
2. The `type` field shall be either `network` or `other` to indicate the kind of provider client. This determines which client has priority when using a feature that is supported by multiple clients, as networks will have priority in such cases ([learn more](/spec)).
3. The `features` field shall be an array with with all features supported by the provider client. A list of features can be found on the [TODO](/spec) page. A provider client providing an empty features array may not receive any requests.


## Provider Clients

Provider clients shall bind to local address `127.0.0.1` on any available port in the range `60860—60867`, inclusive. Once bound, the following identification flow must be satisfied:

<Steps>
1. Provider client receives HTTP `GET` request on `/id`:

    ```http
    GET /id HTTP/1.1
    ```

2. Provider client responds with the below JSON payload, for example

    ```json
    {
        "protocol": "fsdlp",
        "version": 1,
        "provider": {
            "name": "VASTSIM",
            "type": "network",
            "features": ["a", "b", "c"]
        }
    }
    ```
</Steps>

:::note
While not necessarily a focus of this protocol, this method does allow provider clients to discover other providers. This could potentially be useful for automatically detecting if a pilot is flying on a network and/or for a virtual airline.
