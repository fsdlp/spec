title: Service Discovery
---

import { Aside, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';


The key difference between FSDLP and prior solutions is its decentralized nature. Rather than a single entity federating communications between aircraft, air traffic units, and virtual airline operations centers, the responsibility is shared between all of the aforementioned users.

To facilitate this, a method for service discovery is necessary, as an airborne client must know which provider clients are available and what capabilities they posess. A pre-determined port range of `60860—60867` is used to make port scanning easier on airborne clients.

<Aside type="caution">
    The port range above only allows for **up to eight clients** on a single machine. We believe this to be a sufficient quantity, as there are typically at most two at any given moment: a network and a virtual airline.
</Aside>


## Provider Client Identification

Provider clients shall bind to local address `127.0.0.1` on any port in the range `60860—60867`, inclusive. Once bound, clients must satisfy the following exchange in order to be discoverable by airborne clients:

<Steps>
1. Provider client receives HTTP `GET` request on `/id`:

    ```http
    GET /id HTTP/1.1
    ```

2. Provider client responds with the following JSON payload:

    ```json """" "[]"
    {
        "protocol": "fsdlp",
        "version": 1,
        "provider": {
            "name": "",
            "type": "",
            "features": []
        }
    }
    ```

    The `provider.name` field shall be populated with a brief, identifiable name of the network or virtual airline. This information may be shown in virtual cockpits when prompting pilots to establush a data link connection.

    The `provider.type` field shall be populated with either `network` or `other` to indicate the kind of provider client. This determines the prioritization of clients in cases where multiple clients support a particular feature, as networks will take priority in such cases.

    The `provider.features` field shall be populated with a list of all features supported by the provider client.
</Steps>

<Aside>
    While not necessarily a focus of this protocol, this method does allow provider clients to discover other providers and alter their logic in reponse to the presence or absence of other clients.

## Airborne Client Identification

While there are no requirements for an airborne client to be discoverable, as they are are always the first to initiate a data link connection, there are requirements on how an airborne client dicovers available provider clients.
